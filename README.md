## Overview
Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a field of mathematics that uses techniques from topology to interpret data. 
One key tool in in TDA is that of a sheaf.
The notion of a sheaf perfectly captures the idea of local data and how it is glued together to form global data.
In other words, a sheaf is exactly the apparatus that encodes the "sensors" on an arbitrary space.
This library provides a set of traits for building your own sheaf types as well as a set of sheaf types that are commonly used in TDA.
